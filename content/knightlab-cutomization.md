# Customizing Knightlab Tools
## Customizing StorymapJS
Once you've followed the steps to <a href="https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/digital-exhibits-survey/content/digital-storytelling-tools.html#storymapsjs">set up and begin editing StorymapJS</a>, you can customize the look of the Storymap.

## General Storymap Customization
At the very top left of your Storymap interface, there will be a button for "Options". 

Clicking on the "Options" button will open a pop-up menu with two tabs. Below is what they each allow you to do.
a) "Display" tab: customizing the look of the Storymap itself, rather than the individual slides and their contents, and
b) "Share" tab: open the sharing options, which we will explore in <a href="https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/digital-exhibits-survey/content/knightlab-cutomization.html#sharing-customization">Sharing Customization</a>.

<aside class="note">
<strong>Can't click on the "Options" button?</strong> Check if you are on the "editing" tab or "preview" tab at the center-top of you Storymap interface. You have to be in the editing tab to click on the "Options" button.
