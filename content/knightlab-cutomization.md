# Customizing Knightlab Tools
## Customizing StorymapJS
Once you've followed the steps to <a href="https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/digital-exhibits-survey/content/digital-storytelling-tools.html#storymapsjs">set up and begin editing StorymapJS</a>, you can customize the look of the Storymap.

#General Storymap Customization
At the very top left of your Storymap interface, there will be a button for "Options". 

<aside class="note">
The interface provides an editing tab and a preview tab at the top-center of the screen, so you can switch between them as you edit to preview your edits and customizations. <strong>Keep in mind that you <u>cannot change the General Storymap settings while in the preview tab - you have to be in the editing tab</u> to click on the "Options" button.</strong>
</aside>

Clicking on the "Options" button will open a pop-up menu with two tabs. Below is what they each allow you to do.
a) "Display" tab: customizing the look of the Storymap itself, rather than the individual slides and their contents, and
b) "Share" tab: open the sharing options, which we will explore in [Sharing Customization](###Sharing-Customization)

#Display Customization
<strong>StoryMap Size</strong>: This allows you to specify the dimensions of the Storymap that you share. You can also edit this in the "Share" settings.
<strong>Language</strong>: This will set the language of the navigation buttons your completed storymap
