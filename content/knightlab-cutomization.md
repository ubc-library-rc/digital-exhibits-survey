# Customizing Knightlab Tools
## Customizing StoryMapJS
Once you've followed the steps to <a href="https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/digital-exhibits-survey/content/digital-storytelling-tools.html#storymapsjs">set up and begin editing StoryMapJS</a>, you can customize the look of the StoryMap.

## General Storymap Customization
At the very top left of your StoryMap interface, there will be a button for "Options". 

Clicking on the "Options" button will open a pop-up menu with two tabs. Below is what they each allow you to do.
1. "Display" tab: customizing the look of the StoryMap itself, rather than the individual slides and their contents.
2. "Share" tab: open the sharing options, which we will explore in <a href="https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/digital-exhibits-survey/content/knightlab-cutomization.html#sharing-customization">Sharing Customization</a>.

<aside class="note">
<strong>Can't click on the "Options" button?</strong> Check if you are on the "editing" tab or "preview" tab at the center-top of you StoryMap interface. <u>You have to be in the editing tab to click on the "Options" button.</u>

### Display Customization
StoryMap Size: This allows you to specify the dimensions of the StoryMap that you share. You can also edit this in the "Share" settings.
Language: This will set the language of the navigation buttons your completed storymap. 
Fonts: This will determine the fonts used for your StoryMap titles and text boxes. Each font option offers a pair of fonts, the first one is for the titles, the latter for the text boxes.
Language: Use this to change the language setting for the navigational buttons at the top left of the StoryMap, where it would say "Map Overview" and "Back To Beginning."
Treat as Cartography or Image: In the vast majority of cases, this will be set to Cartography. For those interested in using StoryMap to create a tour of an image, you can read <a href="https://storymap.knightlab.com/gigapixel/">Knightlab's guide to StoryMap for Images</a>.
Call to Action: Selecting "yes" will give you a button on the title slide which will read "start exploring" by default. You can edit this text, or select "no" to remove the button (though we recommend keeping it).
Map Type: This will allow you to select either one of the preset Stamen Maps in various colors or upload/link to a custom map or image.

### Customizing Slides
The interface provides an editing tab and a preview tab at the top-center of the screen, so you can switch between them as you edit to preview your edits and customizations.

You will see that your editing interface is split into several sections. A slide overview on the left, a map view at the center, and below the map, an image menu on the left and a text menu on the right.

#### Title Slide
The title slide does not allow you to edit the map, as this map will be populated with all of the geographical points from your other slides.
