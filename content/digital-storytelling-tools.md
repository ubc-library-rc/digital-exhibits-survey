# Scalar

## About Scalar

Scalar is a free, open source multimedia digital publishing platform. [Scalar](https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/features/)  makes it easy “for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online”. It is sponsored by The Alliance for Networking Visual Culture. 

Scalar allows you to take advantage of the Internet to create a multimedia project including essays and book-length works. 

## Creating a Scalar Account 

1. Go to https://scalar.usc.edu/works/ and register for a free account. Note: If you did not receive a registration key from your workshop facilitator, you will need to request a registration key by filling out the form. 

## Getting Started

1. Click on the **Dashboard** to start creating your book!

2. Click on **My Account**. Under **My Books**, add the title of your new book and select **Create New Book**. Your new book will appear under my Books.

3. Select the book you would like to edit from your drop-down menu. Under **Book Properties**, you can add or change basic information (e.g. title and author), style and publisher information. 

## Collaborate and Add Users 

You can add users to your book project so you can collaborate. Collaborators need to have their own Scalar account. Once they are registered, add them by selecting **Book Users**, and selecting **Add user** and searching for their name. 

## Privacy

Please be aware that Scalar stores its data in the United States. If you are asking students to create books using Scalar, students should be made aware of this and given the option to make their work anonymous or to sign up without using personally identifying information. For more information on UBC privacy facts, read the [Privacy Fact Sheet on Collecting Personal Information.](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/files/2020/01/Fact-Sheet-Collecting-Personal-Information.pdf)  

Remember, students at UBC own their intellectual property so they have the right to refuse openly licensing their work. It’s necessary to communicate the risks and value of working in the open and/or public with your students. Librarians can help you with that! 

When you create a book in Scalar, it is automatically set to private. You can make your Scalar book public by selecting the **Sharing** tab in the Dashboard. Under **Availability**, and next to **Make URL public?** select the option from the drop down menu.

## Accessibility 

Accessibility is important. There are steps you can take to make sure you are making the exhibit as accessible as possible. For example, if you are uploading multimedia content such as videos or sound clips, make sure you have included a transcription. When uploading images to websites, you should include alt-text. Alt-text provides a description of an image that can be read by a screen reader.
