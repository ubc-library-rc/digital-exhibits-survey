<p>Static websites differ from dynamic websites in that they are not in consistent communication with a server. In other words, all of the data loads when you access the site and as you interact with it it’s pre-loaded in your browser. As a result static sites are very self-contained and computationally reproducible which gives them longevity. This is particularly important in an academic context.</p>

<h1 id="minimal-computing">Minimal Computing</h1>
<p>Using a static site approach for digital exhibits falls into a way of thinking about digital scholarship that prioritises longevity and different types of “minimalism”. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the project is simple just that it has characteristics that will make it durable.</p>

<p>The goal is to answer two questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who will be able to see your work in 10 years?</li>
  <li>Will they be able to see it or <strong>use it</strong>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Minimal might mean:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Constrained</li>
  <li>Underfunded</li>
  <li>Fewer total number of technologies</li>
  <li>Easier to maintain long-term</li>
  <li>Fewer <strong>“dependencies”</strong></li>
  <li>Formats that are <strong>“future proofed”</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that open source tools are <br /> free as in kitten not free as in beer.</p>

<p>Technical debt</p>

<p>Higher likelihood that it will keep working into the future because of simpler component parts with fewer dependencies.</p>

<h1 id="wax">Wax</h1>
<p>Wax is a minimal computing publishing tool for the creation of academic digital exhibits using a IIIF viewer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leveraged <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and Github Pages</li>
  <li>Uses <a href="https://iiif.io/" target="_blank">IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework)(<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9SPg9nlLA3TAdzkYxkyaFFNNf8m4PsbaIExcYwVLyo/edit#heading=h.q7mmne7d3bk2" target="_blank">why IIIF?</a>)&lt;/li&gt;
  <li>Uses <a href="https://openseadragon.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenSeaDragon</a> viewer but can use any other</li>
  <li>Creates a relatively small static site (vs. dynamic)</li>
&lt;/ul&gt;
