<p>For researchers, digital exhibits can provide an opportunity to communicate research to a broader audience. Digital exhibits can be used to highlight research on many different topics. <a href="https://seahorseproject.omeka.net/">The Seahorse Project</a>, <a href="https://cawomenforag.omeka.ne">California Women for Agriculture</a>, <a href="https://latinahistoryproject.omeka.net/">The Latina History Project</a>, are all examples of websites built using Omeka.net.</p>

<p>Digital exhibit assignments can provide studentsâ€“both undergraduate and graduateâ€“ with opportunities to learn new skills and engage in public research. Skills such as primary source research, digital literacy skills (how to choose a source and evaluate it), knowledge of copyright, open access, and Creative Commons licenses, as well as working with content management systems and creating metadata.</p>

<p>There is a lot of flexibility as to how to incorporate digital exhibits as an assignment. For example, you can either ask students to create their own exhibit or ask students to work collaboratively to create one classroom exhibit.</p>
