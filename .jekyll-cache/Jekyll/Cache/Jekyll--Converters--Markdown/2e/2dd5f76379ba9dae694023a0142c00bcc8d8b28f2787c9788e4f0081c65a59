<p><a href="https://omeka.org/about/project/">â€œOmekaâ€</a> is a Swahili word meaning â€œto display or lay out waresâ€. Developed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, Omeka is a free, open source publishing tool, or content management system, that allows you to curate digital collections and make a searchable database. There are currently three instances of Omeka including Omeka.org, Omeka.net, and Omeka S.</p>

<h3 id="omekaorg-vs-omekanet-vs-omeka-s">Omeka.org vs. Omeka.net vs. Omeka S</h3>

<p>Omega.org needs to be hosted on a web hosting server. It is free and highly customizable but requires more expertise to build.</p>

<p>Omeka S was created for institutions to manage multiple sites.</p>

<p>Omeka.net is hosted on Omeka servers. It is easier to use but it is less customizable. Omeka.net offers a tiered, paid subscription as well as a free trial version. The trial version allows you to build 1 site, with 500 MB of storage space. It has very limited plugins or aesthetic features but itâ€™s a great starting point for beginners and learning how to use Omeka.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading-your-omekanet-account">Upgrading your Omeka.net account</h3>

<p>Omeka.net has a tiered, paid subscription service. You can upgrade your plan at any time.</p>
