There are currently three instances of Omeka including Omeka.org, Omeka.net, and Omeka S. Omeka.org vs. Omeka.net vs. Omeka S . Omega.org needs to be hosted on a web hosting server. It is free and highly customizable but requires more expertise to build. Omeka S was created for institutions to manage multiple sites. Omeka.net is hosted on Omeka servers. It is easier to use but it is less customizable. Omeka.net offers a tiered, paid subscription as well as a free trial version. The trial version allows you to build 1 site, with 500 MB of storage space. It has very limited plugins or aesthetic features but it’s a great starting point for beginners and learning how to use Omeka. Upgrading your Omeka.net account .

Omeka also allows you to add metadata to each item. Metadata is information about an item such as title, author, publisher, date, etc. Omeka.net uses the Dublin Core metadata schema which is easy to modify. Metadata makes the items on your website searachable. Omeka provides the fields for you to enter the information. Feel free to modify but try and stay consistent. Collections are useful for grouping or organizing items. You can link between items in different collections using tags. Tags allow you to link items together with terms of your choosing. When any two items have the same tag, the tag automatically turns into a link. Omeka sites allow you to browse items by tag. Items do not have to be in collections, but once an item is in a collection, it can’t be in any other collection. An exhibit is the process of carefully choosing items and arranging them to create a narrative or story using different layouts and additional text. Even with Omeka.net, you have the ability to modify how you arrange your exhibit. ",
